# Basic Layout

This example shows a basic layout made up of two vertical lists and a horizontal list.

### Features Demonstrated

- The `orientation` prop, specifying whether or not a list is horizontal or vertical
- The `.isFocused` and `.isFocusedLeaf` class names to style the focused nodes
- The default navigation behavior: the first item in a list will be focused
